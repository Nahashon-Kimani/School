    <string name="test">Internally, FAB has two main implementations: one for SDK >= 21, one for
       earlier versions; the one for older versions uses extra padding in order to draw shadows; you don\'t
       need to account for the extra padding as the library takes care of it
        When used in a CoordinatorLayout FAB is known to have its margin values i
       gnored / misused under certain circumstances; as a workaround the library alway
       s adds left or right margin values (depending on gravity), taking into account the SDK version too.</string>
